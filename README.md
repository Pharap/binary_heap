# binary_heap

An implementation of a binary heap in pure standard C++11, using C++ standard library features.

This code is mainly for educational purposes as the standard library already provides
[`std::priority_queue`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/priority_queue) which behaves similarly
and is likely to be implemented in almost exactly the same way in most implementations of the standard library.
